# (More Than) Smoke and Mirrors: Virtual Training Data for Real World Computer Vision Tasks

Improving wildfire smoke detection models by creating virtual training data in Unreal Engine 5.

This repository contains UE source code for creating environments to capture virtual smoke imagery, Python scripts implementing smoke detection machine learning models, and notebooks evaluating model performance when trained on real versus virtual data sources.
